# Blockchain Hyperledger With Fabric CA, Fabric, Explorer, Raft, Chaincode and Monitoring

Establishing a corporate blockchain network in a productive environment has some challenges that must be solved by blockchain solution architects. This repository was organized from our experience in creating blockchain environments, quality and productive, for a software system that uses blockchain as a data storage solution in its backend to execute a decentralized and distributed multi-organization business process. 

The source-code will focus on how the blockchain architect may use sources to configure the Hyperledger frameworks together, Fabric CA + Fabric + Explorer, on a network with multiple Raft orderers, and how to guide the developmentto establish resources that can provide the monitoring over the blockchain components of organization, as well as the verification of each chaincode that is published in the system.
